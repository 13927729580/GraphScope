    A One-Stop Large-Scale Graph Computing System from Alibaba
</p>

GraphScope is a unified distributed graph computing platform that provides a one-stop environment for performing diverse graph operations on a cluster of computers through a user-friendly Python interface. GraphScope makes multi-staged processing of large-scale graph data on compute clusters simple by combining several important pieces of Alibaba technology: including [GRAPE](https://github.com/alibaba/libgrape-lite), [GraphCompute](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/134189.html), and [Graph-Learn](https://github.com/alibaba/graph-learn) (GL) for analytics, interactive, and graph neural networks (GNN) computation, respectively, and the [vineyard](https://github.com/alibaba/libvineyard) store that offers efficient in-memory data transfers.

We will release GraphScope 1.0 as open source under the Apache 2.0 license soon.
